# Spring Cloud Contract

Consumer-driven contracts (CDC) is a pattern for specifying and verifying interactions between different modules of an application. Consumer-driven means that it is the responsibility of the Consumer to specify what interactions it is relying on, as well as their format. Other services must then agree to these contracts and ensure that they are not breaking them.
